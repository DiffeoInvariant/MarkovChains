# Markov
A C++17 library for Markov chains. The -O3 compiler flag is recommended, and can lead to 40x or more speedups. -Ofast is not recommended, as it can lead to rounding, which can be significant if computing large matrix powers or conducting perfect sampling over a large state space. In terms of the code generated by compilers, best speed has been achieved by Intel C++ with processor-specific optimization turned on. Without processor-specific optimization though, Clang++ may be slightly faster. 

The full compile/link line for programs using this library is

clang++ -std=c++17 -O3 program.cpp ${INCLUDE} -I/${MARKOVROOT}/include -I${MKLROOT}/include ${MKLROOT}/lib/libmkl_intel_lp64.a ${MKLROOT}/lib/libmkl_intel_thread.a ${MKLROOT}/lib/libmkl_core.a  ${MARKOVROOT}/lib/libmarkov.a -liomp5 -lpthread -lm -ldl

where

INCLUDE=`pkg-config --cflags --libs eigen3 gsl ` 

MKLROOT can be found for your device with the Intel MKL Link Line Advisor (https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-mkl-link-line-advisor)

MARKOVROOT is the directory containing the Markov library (for me, that's /Users/zanejakobs/Desktop/Markov/)
