# MarkovChains
A collection of C++ classes and methods related to Markov Chains. Will eventually be turned into a full library. Note that this program is written to the C++17 standard. If you're running this code with large matrices or otherwise computationally expensive calculations, the -O3 -DNDEBUG compiler flags are recommended, and can lead to 40x or more speedups. -Ofast is not recommended, as it can lead to rounding, which can be significant if computing large matrix powers or conducting perfect sampling over a large state space. In terms of the code generated by compilers, best speed has been achieved by Intel C++ with processor-specific optimization turned on. Without processor-specific optimization though, Clang++ may be slightly faster. 

If you encounter any bugs, please report them to zane.jakobs@colorado.edu. If your bug comes when running markovDriver.cpp--in particular if the program terminates with an uncaught exception--please include your terminal i/o in the bug report.
